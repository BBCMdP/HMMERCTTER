The datasets are organized in folders and each superfamily in general will contain at least 4 files and a folder Analysis_Output containing the data obtained for the analyses included in the first manuscript. When a certain family has been rerun as indicated in the MS, this is indicated with numbers which are referenced below. 
*For clustering you need the XX_Train.fsa (containing the unaligned sequences) and the XX_Train.tree (which contains the train in Newick format). 
*For classification you need XX_Target.fsa (containing the unaligned sequences). 
*The file Reference.tree contains the tree made from the combined Train and Target sequence sets and is ONLY used as external reference. Do not use this tree for clustering.
*We have added the datasets generated by HMMERCTTER of all analyses discussed and shown in the figures, excluding the supplemental figures. Please be aware of the fact that HMMERCTTER combines train and target datasets and reports accordingly.

1 ACD Case: The datasets of the first run and second as described in the original manuscript are labeled with 1 and 2 respectively. 
2 PLC Case: The clustering datasets of the first and second run as described in the original Manuscript are labeled with 1 and 2 respectively.
